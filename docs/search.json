    "section": "Accounting for sex differences in genetic architecture",
    "text": "Accounting for sex differences in genetic architecture\nAs stated above, inclusive fitness in the absence of inbreeding depression is \\((1 + r)n\\). Here \\(r\\) represents the correlation between genotypes carried by interacting females and males, under the implicit assumption that loci appear equally in both sexes. However, given that there is sexual dimorphism in genetic architecture for many taxa, \\(r\\) does not sufficiently represent the correlation between genotypes for all loci.\nTo delineate differences in the effect of \\(r\\) for different regions of the genome, we multiply \\(r\\) with a new variable \\(a\\), the probability that a locus present in one sex is also present in the gametes produced by the other. Unlike \\(r\\) which is relative to the population mean relatedness, \\(a\\) is expressed as an absolute value ranging from 0 to 1.\nThe indirect component of fitness accrued by from an inbred mating becomes\n\\[ran\\]\nand inclusive fitness from an inbreeding event becomes\n\\[(1 + ra)(1 - \\delta )n\\]\nTaking an allele found at a diploid autosomal locus as an example, all of the gametes produced by a relative possess this locus, where they could potentially carry alleles identical by descent. In this case \\(a = 1\\) and the indirect component of inclusive fitness is dictated solely by \\(r\\). The results for this autosomal scenario are presented in Parker (1979), Kokko and Ots (2006) and others who have explored this topic. In contrast, an inbreeding preference allele present at a locus on a Y or W chromosome has no opportunity to propagate any alleles identical by descent through inbreeding, as these chromosomes are not carried by the gametes of the opposite sex mating partner. In this case \\(a = 0\\). However, as inbreeding depression is a result of homozygosity for deleterious recessive alleles throughout the genome, the costs of inbreeding depression are born by all alleles carried by the individual. Conflict over the expression of inbreeding preference between alleles present on autosomes and those present on hemizygous sex chromosomes is immediately clear.\nX- or Z-linked loci present an interesting intermediate case, with sex-specific values for \\(a\\). When the inbreeding locus is carried by the sex with homozygous sex chromosomes, \\(a\\) is half that of autosomal loci, whereas it does not depart from the autosomal case when the locus is found within the hemizygous sex. Using loci on the X as an example, those present in a XX female are only found in ~50% of a interacting males gametes, as the remaining 50% carry Y chromosomes (assuming an even primary sex ratio). When an X-linked locus is found in a male, an interacting femaleâ€™s gametes all carry X chromosomes and \\(a = 1\\).\nThe X/Z situation is made additionally complex because there is an element of frequency dependence to the kin selected benefits. When an inbreeding allele on an autosome is rare, then the chance of a relative carrying two copies is low, whereas when the allele is common, this chance is much higher. Rarity therefore leads to similar fitness outcomes for autosomal and X/Z linked alleles (when present in the hemizygous sex), while commonality of the allele likely roughly equates to the conflicting situation outlined in the above paragraph.

    "text": "Differences between the sexes beyond genetic architecture\nParkerâ€™s seminal equations:\nIn his 1979 book chapter, Parker considered the inclusive fitness results of breeding with a relative and identified that females and males should have different tolerances for inbreeding depression. The key departure from the unlimited polygyny case presented in the above equations is that a cost to future reproductive success is included for males, i.e.Â due to finite sperm production, parental care, or harmful mating behaviour such as sexual cannibalism.\nFor males, Parker found that selection would favour inbreeding with a sister (full-sib) who could otherwise outcross when:\n\\[n(1 - \\delta) + rn(1- \\delta) - cn \\gt rn\\]\nthe first term is the direct number of alleles propagated, the second term is the indirect number of alleles propagated (note that this is weighted by relatedness), the third term is the direct number of alleles that were not directly propagated by the male through outcrossing, and the final opposing term is the number of alleles that wouldâ€™ve been transmitted had his sister outcrossed (and he forgone mating).\n\\(c\\) is the cost of the present mating, relative to what is lost for a female. This can be considered a ratio of parental investment. When \\(c = 1\\) parental investment in the current bout of reproduction is even between the sexes. Alternatively, if males only contribute cheaply produced sperm to an incestuous mating, the cost of mating is likely very small relative to females i.e.Â \\(c ~ 0\\).\nWe add the \\(a\\) variable to the equation and letting \\(n = 1\\), simplify to\n\\[(1-\\delta) + ra(1-\\delta) - c \\gt ra\\]\nWe can again find the condition where breeding with a relative returns greater fitness than an inbreeding avoidance strategy:\n\\[\\delta_{male} = \\frac{1 - c}{1 + ra}\\]\nParker then modelled the condition for monandrous females to prefer incestuous matings when also presented with an outcrossing opportunity.\n\\[n(1 - \\delta) + rn(1-\\delta) - crn \\gt n\\]\nwhich we can write as\n\\[(1-\\delta) + ra(1-\\delta) - rac \\gt 1\\]\nthe inbreeding depression threshold is\n\\[\\delta_{female} = \\frac{ra - rac}{1 + ra}\\]\nNote that when \\(c = 0\\), this is equivalent to the \\(\\delta\\) threshold found in the single mating case.\nPlot the relationship between \\(r\\) and \\(\\delta\\) for several values of \\(c\\) and \\(a\\)\n\n\nCode\nParker_cost_data &lt;- \n  expand_grid(r = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),\n              a = c(0, 0.5, 1),\n              c = c(0, 0.5, 0.9),\n              Sex = c(\"Female\", \"Male\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(inbreeding_depression = case_when(Sex == \"Female\" ~ (r*a - r*a*c) / (r*a + 1),\n                                           Sex == \"Male\" ~ (1 - c) / (r*a + 1)))\n\n  Parker_cost_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(a = as.factor(a)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = inbreeding_depression, linetype = a, colour = Sex)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.9) + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"Female\" = met.brewer(\"Peru1\", 6)[2], \"Male\" =  met.brewer(\"Peru1\", 6)[3])) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1)) +\n  labs(y = expression(delta), \n       x = expression(italic(\"r\")),\n       linetype = expression(italic(\"a\"))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.009, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +\n  facet_wrap(~c, nrow = 3, labeller = label_glue('Male mating investment (c): {c}')) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 14),\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"Aliceblue\", linewidth = .5))"

Note that intra-chromosomal conflict encompasses both the intra- and inter-locus forms of sexual conflict.\n\n\nCode\nautosomal_data &lt;-\n  results %&gt;%\n  filter(a == 1, c != 1, c != 0.25) %&gt;% \n  #mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = male_fitness_contrast - female_fitness_contrast) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = female_fitness_contrast * male_fitness_contrast / \n           sqrt(((female_fitness_contrast)^2 + (male_fitness_contrast)^2)/2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(relationship = \n           case_when(female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Sexual conflict\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding deleterious in both contexts\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding favoured in both contexts\"),\n         Location = \"Autosome\") \n  \n\n\nX_data &lt;- \n  results %&gt;% \n  filter(a == 0.5, c != 1, c != 0.25) %&gt;%  \n  select(1:4, contains(\"female\")) %&gt;% \n  rename(a_female = a) %&gt;% # this step makes the join work as intended\n  left_join(\n    results %&gt;% \n      filter(a == 1, c != 1, c != 0.25) %&gt;% \n      select(1:4, starts_with(\"male\")) %&gt;% \n      rename(a_male = a) # this step makes the join work as intended\n  ) %&gt;%\n  #mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = male_fitness_contrast - female_fitness_contrast) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = female_fitness_contrast * male_fitness_contrast / \n           sqrt(((female_fitness_contrast)^2 + (male_fitness_contrast)^2)/2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(relationship = \n           case_when(female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Sexual conflict\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding deleterious in both contexts\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding favoured in both contexts\"),\n         Location = \"X\")\n\nZ_data &lt;-\n  results %&gt;% \n  filter(a == 1, c != 1, c != 0.25) %&gt;%  \n  select(1:4, contains(\"female\")) %&gt;% \n  rename(a_female = a) %&gt;% \n  left_join(\n    results %&gt;% \n      filter(a == 0.5, c != 1, c != 0.25) %&gt;% \n      select(1:4, starts_with(\"male\")) %&gt;% \n      rename(a_male = a)\n  ) %&gt;% \n  #mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = male_fitness_contrast - female_fitness_contrast) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Evolutionary_conflict = female_fitness_contrast * male_fitness_contrast / \n           sqrt(((female_fitness_contrast)^2 + (male_fitness_contrast)^2)/2)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(relationship = \n           case_when(female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Sexual conflict\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &lt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding deleterious in both contexts\",\n                     female_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 & male_fitness_contrast &gt; 0 \n                     ~ \"Inbreeding favoured in both contexts\"),\n         Location = \"Z\")\n\nplotting_data &lt;- bind_rows(autosomal_data, X_data, Z_data) %&gt;% filter(c == 0)\n\nSexual_conflict_plot &lt;-\n  plotting_data %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = D)) +\n  geom_blank() +\n  geom_tile(data = plotting_data %&gt;% filter(relationship == \"Sexual conflict\"),\n            aes(fill = Evolutionary_conflict*-1)) + \n  #scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal2, limits = c(-1.2, 1.1), #na.value = \"white\",\n   #                    labels = c(\"Strong conflict, female (+)\", -0.5, \n    #                              \"No conflict\", 0.5, \"Strong conflict, male (+)\")) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = oranges, limits = c(0, 0.6), #na.value = \"white\",\n                       breaks = c(0, 0.6),\n                       labels = c(\"Weak conflict\", \"Strong conflict\")) +\n  labs(fill = \"Evolutionary conflict\") +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_tile(data = plotting_data %&gt;% filter(relationship != \"Sexual conflict\"),\n            aes(fill = relationship), alpha = 0.75) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#fbe6c5\", \"#d2fbd4\"), \n                    labels = c(\"Inbreeding deleterious\\nin both contexts\", \n                               \"Inbreeding favoured\\nin both contexts\")) +\n  stat_contour(aes(z = Evolutionary_conflict*-1), colour = \"black\", binwidth = 25,\n                   breaks = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Location, nrow = 3,\n             scales = \"free\", strip.position = c(\"top\"),\n             labeller = label_glue('{`Location`}')) +\n  labs(x = '_r_ (relatedness coefficient)',\n       y = ~delta~'(inbreeding depression)',\n       fill = \"Evolutionary concordance\",\n       title = \"C.

Things that matter include:\n\ndo we consider inbreeding expression as the additive result of multiple loci on different chromosomes, or do we consider each case separately. Probably not this\nis inbreeding expression binary, a threshold trait or a quantitative, normally distributed trait. The latter would allow us to model evolution towards some maximum. The former cases are simpler to code (particularly the first case) but still allow us to answer a very similar question.

    "text": "Build a function to create the starting population\nFollowing Ekrem and Kokko (2023), we find the reproductive lifespans of N diploid individuals in a sexually reproducing population to initialise the simulation. Mortality events are drawn from an exponential distribution with rate \\(\\lambda = 1/\\mu\\).

First we determine the frequencies of each genotype in the mating population (this could be, for example, after weâ€™ve accounted for inbreeding costs), then we calculate the frequencies of each potential mating combination between these genotypes.\nStep 1 - finding the genotype frequencies in the mating population\nHere we can model an inbreeding depression effect, by changing the viability of different genotypes. I make this a constant for now, to aid my initial understanding, but later this will be one of the key parameters to vary.\nI have also allowed the dominance of \\(a\\) to vary. While inbreeding depression is the result of the increased expression of recessive alleles through homozygosity, partially recessive alleles are likely to be common. When \\(h = 1\\), the \\(a\\) allele is completely recessive.\n\n\nCode\negg_adult_viability_Aa_finder &lt;- function(h){1 - 0.33*(1 - h)}\n\n\n# viability of each genotype \n\negg_adult_viability_AA_female &lt;- 1\n\negg_adult_viability_Aa_female &lt;- egg_adult_viability_Aa_finder(h = 1)\n\negg_adult_viability_aa_female &lt;- 0.67\n\negg_adult_viability_AA_male &lt;- 1\n\negg_adult_viability_Aa_male &lt;- egg_adult_viability_Aa_finder(h = 1)\n\negg_adult_viability_aa_male &lt;- 0.67\n\n\nUsing these parameters, we implement selection, so that each genotype is represented in the mating combinations according to the product of its frequency and its viability, which is determined by inbreeding depression. I assume that mating success is constant across genotypes (this may not be possible if one allele approaches extinction).\nStep 2 - finding the frequency of all potential mating combinations in the mating population\nNext, we model the effect of inbreeding preference on inclusive fitness (direct + indirect fitness). I first assume that individuals are faced with a simultaneous choice situation - between mating with a relative or mating with an unrelated individual.\nFor simplicity at the outset, I assume that inbreeding preference is only expressed in females. To simulate inbreeding preference, females carrying the \\(a\\) allele mate with siblings (those individuals produced by the same parental genotype combination). However, dominance also plays a role here. A proportion \\(1 - h\\) of \\(Aa\\) females express inbreeding preference, whereas a proportion \\(h\\) do not.\nWith the above in mind, I calculate the expected frequencies of each possible â€˜mating combinationâ€™ (i.e.Â the combination of the maternal and paternal genotypes) across the population. For singly-mated females with genotype \\(AA\\), the frequency of each mating type is simply given by \\(F_iM_j\\), where \\(F_i\\) and \\(M_j\\) are the female and male parental genotype frequencies, that is they choose mates at random. For females with genotype \\(Aa\\) a proportion \\(1 - h\\) express a preference for inbreeding. For these females, the expected frequencies for each mating type are determined by the parental mating type combination they were produced by.

    "text": "This is a two-step process. First we determine the frequencies of each genotype in the mating population (this could be, for example, after weâ€™ve accounted for inbreeding costs), then we calculate the frequencies of each potential mating combination between these genotypes.\nStep 1 - finding the genotype frequencies in the mating population\nHere we can model an inbreeding depression effect, by changing the viability of different genotypes. I make this a constant for now, to aid my initial understanding, but later this will be one of the key parameters to vary.\nI have also allowed the dominance of \\(a\\) to vary. While inbreeding depression is the result of the increased expression of recessive alleles through homozygosity, partially recessive alleles are likely to be common. When \\(h = 1\\), the \\(a\\) allele is completely recessive.\n\n\nCode\negg_adult_viability_Aa_finder &lt;- function(h){1 - 0.33*(1 - h)}\n\n\n# viability of each genotype \n\negg_adult_viability_AA_female &lt;- 1\n\negg_adult_viability_Aa_female &lt;- egg_adult_viability_Aa_finder(h = 1)\n\negg_adult_viability_aa_female &lt;- 0.67\n\negg_adult_viability_AA_male &lt;- 1\n\negg_adult_viability_Aa_male &lt;- egg_adult_viability_Aa_finder(h = 1)\n\negg_adult_viability_aa_male &lt;- 0.67\n\n\nUsing these parameters, we implement selection, so that each genotype is represented in the mating combinations according to the product of its frequency and its viability, which is determined by inbreeding depression. I assume that mating success is constant across genotypes (this may not be possible if one allele approaches extinction).\nStep 2 - finding the frequency of all potential mating combinations in the mating population\nNext, we model the effect of inbreeding preference on inclusive fitness (direct + indirect fitness). I first assume that individuals are faced with a simultaneous choice situation - between mating with a relative or mating with an unrelated individual.\nFor simplicity at the outset, I assume that inbreeding preference is only expressed in females. To simulate inbreeding preference, females carrying the \\(a\\) allele mate with siblings (those individuals produced by the same parental genotype combination). However, dominance also plays a role here. A proportion \\(1 - h\\) of \\(Aa\\) females express inbreeding preference, whereas a proportion \\(h\\) do not.\nWith the above in mind, I calculate the expected frequencies of each possible â€˜mating combinationâ€™ (i.e.Â the combination of the maternal and paternal genotypes) across the population. For singly-mated females with genotype \\(AA\\), the frequency of each mating type is simply given by \\(F_iM_j\\), where \\(F_i\\) and \\(M_j\\) are the female and male parental genotype frequencies, that is they choose mates at random. For females with genotype \\(Aa\\) a proportion \\(1 - h\\) express a preference for inbreeding. For these females, the expected frequencies for each mating type are determined by the parental mating type combination they were produced by. These females randomly choose a mate from a subset of possible genotypes produced by the parental combination e.g.Â an \\(AA\\) x \\(aa\\) mating will produce a female that will choose to mate with a \\(Aa\\) male (the only possible genotype of her brothers). The proportion \\(h\\) of \\(Aa\\) females not expressing the \\(a\\) allele choose mates at random.

The choosing sex can either mate with this individual or elect not to mate and wait for a future opportunity.\nNot mating produces the inclusive fitness:\n\\[v_I + ro_iw_I\\] Now an inbreeding preference strategy is favoured where\n\\[v_O + ro_iw_O + (1 + ro_i)(1 - \\delta)a(v_I + w_1) \\gt v_I + ro_iw_I\\]\nThus, the threshold \\(\\delta\\) value below which inbreeding is adaptive is\n\\[\\delta_{seq} = 1 - \\frac{(v_I - v_O) + ro_i(w_I - w_O)}{a(1 + ro_i)(v_I + w_I)}\\] \\(~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(~\\)\n$$\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}dv_I/dt\\\\\ndv_O/dt\\\\\ndw_I/dt\\\\\ndw_O/dt\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n=\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}-\\mu_{Iv} + m_v(a - 1)  & m_v & am_v &  0\\\\\n1/T_v & 1/T_v -\\mu_{Ov} & 0 & 0\\\\\nam_w & 0 & -\\mu_{Iw} + m_w(a - 1) & m_w\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1/Tw & 1/T_w -\\mu_{Ow}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}v_I\\\\\nv_O\\\\\nw_I\\\\\nw_O\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n$$\n\n\n\nCode\nm1 &lt;- matrix(c(1:4), ncol = 1)\n\nm2 &lt;- matrix(c(1:16), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)\n\nm2 %*% m1\n\n\n     [,1]\n[1,]   90\n[2,]  100\n[3,]  110\n[4,]  120\n\n\nCreate a function to calculate reproductive value for each state\n\n\nCode\nchange_repro_values &lt;- \n  matrix(c(-1*death_rate_in_choosy_sex + mating_rate_choosy_sex *(a - 1),\n           mating_rate_choosy_sex,\n           a*mating_rate_choosy_sex,\n           0,\n           1/time_out_duration_choosy_sex,\n           -1/time_out_duration_choosy_sex - death_rate_out_choosy_sex,\n           0,\n           0,\n           a*mating_rate_opp_sex,\n           0,\n           -1*death_rate_in_opp_sex + mating_rate_opp_sex *(a - 1),\n           mating_rate_opp_sex,\n           0,\n           0,\n           1/time_out_duration_opp_sex,\n           -1/time_out_duration_opp_sex - death_rate_out_opp_sex),\n         nrow = 4, ncol = 4)\n\nstate_repro_values &lt;- c(vI, vO, wI, wO)\n\nparameters &lt;- \n  expand_grid(r = 0.5,\n              x = c(0, 0.5, 1),\n              death_rate_in_choosy_sex = 1,\n              mating_rate_choosy_sex = ,\n              time_out_duration_choosy_sex = c(0.1, 0.01),\n              death_rate_out_choosy_sex = 1,\n              mating_rate_opp_sex = ,\n              death_rate_in_opp_sex = 1,\n              time_out_duration_opp_sex = ,\n              death_rate_out_opp_sex = 1,\n              a = ((mating_rate_choosy_sex*(1/time_out_duration_choosy_sex + death_rate_in_choosy_sex)/\n                      (death_rate_out_choosy_sex/time_out_duration_choosy_sex + \n                         death_rate_in_choosy_sex*(mating_rate_choosy_sex + death_rate_out_choosy_sex)))^-1)/2\n  )"

Our simulation therefore estimates the condition required for inbreeding avoidance to invade. One consequence of inbreeding avoidance is an increased risk of going unmated for both sexes when they forego mating with a relative, particularly when the cost of mating for males is large, or search efficiency is low."

Inbreeding can evolve through selection on either sex, but there is very little sexual antagonism over inbreeding, as selection optimises female fitness in both cases. The extent to which the inbreeding strategy is favoured can vary but the sign will never be opposing.\n\n\nCode\nFemale_cyto_plot &lt;-\n  results %&gt;%\n  filter(v != 10, C != 2 & C != 4, a == 0) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = D)) +\n  geom_blank() +\n  geom_raster(aes(fill = female_fitness_contrast)) + \n  stat_contour(aes(z = female_fitness_contrast*100), colour = \"black\", binwidth = 25,\n               breaks = c(-100, -75, -50, -25, 25, 50, 75, 100)) +\n  stat_contour(aes(z = female_fitness_contrast*100), colour = \"black\", breaks = 0,\n               linetype = 2) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal1, breaks = c(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1), limits = c(-1.5, 1.5)) +\n  facet_wrap(v ~ C, \n             scales = \"free\", nrow = 3, strip.position = c(\"top\"),\n             labeller = label_glue('v = {`v`}, C = {`C`}')) +\n  labs(x = expression(~italic(r)~', the relatedness coefficient'),\n       y = ~delta~'(inbreeding depression)',\n       fill = \"Inbreeding fitness\",\n       subtitle = \"Alleles present in females\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + # labels = c(0, 25, 50, 75, 90)) +\n  theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = \"black\", linewidth = .8),\n        strip.background = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = \"Aliceblue\", size = .8))\n\n\nMale_cyto_plot &lt;-\n  results %&gt;%\n  filter(v != 10, C != 2 & C != 4, a == 1) %&gt;%  \n  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = D)) +\n  geom_blank() +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = cyto_male_fitness_contrast)) + \n  stat_contour(aes(z = cyto_male_fitness_contrast*100), colour = \"black\", binwidth = 25,\n               breaks = c(-75, -50, -25, 25, 50, 75, 100)) +\n  stat_contour(aes(z = cyto_male_fitness_contrast*100), colour = \"black\", breaks = 0,\n               linetype = 2) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = pal1, breaks = c(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1), limits = c(-1.5, 1.5)) +\n  facet_wrap(v ~ C,\n             scales = \"free\", nrow = 3, strip.position = c(\"top\"),\n             labeller = label_glue('v = {`v`}, C = {`C`}')) +\n  labs(x = expression(~italic(r)~', the relatedness coefficient'),\n       y = ~delta~'(inbreeding depression)',\n       fill = \"Inbreeding fitness\",\n       subtitle = \"Cytoplasmic alleles present in males\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + # labels = c(0, 25, 50, 75, 90)) +\n  theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = \"black\", size = .8),\n        strip.background = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = \"Aliceblue\", size = .8))\n\nFemale_cyto_plot\n\nMale_cyto_plot"
