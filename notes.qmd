## Project background / notes

### 25/05/2023

**Premise outline**

This project centres around the fate of alleles that encode inbreeding preference / avoidance depending on where they occur within the genome. 

But the deeper idea is that inbreeding is a 'selfish action' where some alleles benefit from helping copies of themselves in other individuals, to the detriment of the broader organism. This detriment occurs because of inbreeding depression, which occurs because of homozygosity at other loci across the genome. Homozygosity causes the expression of recessive deleterious alleles which are otherwise rarely expressed, reducing the number of viable offspring produced by the organism.

To represent the broader genome, we can use alleles on hemizygous sex chromosomes, which have no opportunity to be homozygous and thus can gain no benefits of helping a relative gain a breeding opportunity. This broadly aligns with the 'interests' of the organism. For example, in an XY system alleles on the Y do not increase the propagation of alleles identical by descent through inbreeding, because females do not carry a Y. An autosomal allele, however, does have the potential to increase the proliferation of its copies by increasing the chance of breeding with a relative. This benefit is somewhat similar to that **achieved by meiotic drive allele** (clarify your thoughts here).

A second potential angle is to explore the effect of the sex an allele encoding a preference for inbreeding is expressed in. This is important because the conditions often applicable to expression in a male present a greater parameter space for inbreeding preference (to put it too simply, because males invest less in each mating opportunity than females). Sex-specific effects also interact with hemizygous conditions, because in addition to XY systems, ZW systems exist and suddenly hemizygous chromosomes are present in females. 

So in sum, there is a likely conflict between alleles on different chromosomes over the tendency to inbreed and there is a second non-mutually exclusive conflict between the sexes over inbreeding tendency. Wow, this is cool.

This idea might be deeper still. We point out that alleles on hemizygous sex chromosomes gain no indirect inclusive fitness benefits by mating with kin. The kicker is that inbreeding is just one example of this larger idea. There are no inclusive fitness benefits for alleles that encode _any_ altruistic behaviour towards opposite sex individuals (where one sex possesses a hemizygous sex chromosome).      

**Some specific notes from the meeting**

- [Hanna's 2006 paper](https://academic.oup.com/evolut/article/60/3/467/6756586?login=true) shows when a preference for inbreeding should or should not be favoured for an autosomal allele, but does not consider other regions of the genome.

- Start with the Parker 1/3 thing, which Hanna and co re-derive. But they implicitly assume that the alleles in question here are on an autosome. We can make the change that they are on a sex chromosome, as stipulated above. 

- The X and Z can also be explored, because of their unusual inheritance dynamics. E.g. the X spends 2/3 of its time in females, but is always expressed in males and vice versa for the W. 

- Does it matter whether the loci that cause inbreeding depression are on the same/different chromosomes as those that encode inbreeding preferences...   

- Birds versus mammals, flies versus butterflies etc - different hemizygous sex chromosomes

- Unity breaks down because of inheritance differences

- Hamilton 1967 extraordinary sex chromosomes paper is a nice angle here

- Haplodiploidy - this is an extension opportunity.

- I will also try to simulate this question.

- Hanna suggests that the time in, time out continuous framework might not be the best option, as it is not the most intuitive for others. 

- Perhaps keeping it simple may be the best way forward - females mate once, males mate multiple times. This produces differences in the opportunity cost of mating between the sexes.

- A discrete time model might work better

- Scottish group models the inbreeding problem in helpful ways

- Another way is to follow the Ekrem paper and simulate in an intelligent way (this method might be particularly fruitful)

- Essentially browse the different ways to approach the problem and follow one you like best.

- Models like our developing one do not consider purging dynamics that should occur if inbreeding becomes common.
